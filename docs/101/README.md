# Cloud Technologies 101 - Learning Path

Welcome to your comprehensive learning journey! This directory contains beginner-friendly guides for mastering all the technologies used in this project.

## 🎯 Learning Philosophy

**Learn Locally → Master Concepts → Deploy to Cloud**

This approach helps you:
- Understand fundamentals without cloud costs
- Experiment freely without breaking production
- Build confidence before managing cloud resources
- Debug issues more easily in a controlled environment

## 📚 Learning Path

### Phase 1: Containerization & Orchestration
1. **[Kubernetes 101](./01-KUBERNETES-101.md)** ⭐ START HERE
   - Local vs Cloud Kubernetes
   - Setting up local Kubernetes (minikube, kind, Docker Desktop)
   - Core concepts: Pods, Deployments, Services
   - Hands-on exercises

2. **[Helm 101](./02-HELM-101.md)**
   - What is Helm and why use it?
   - Charts, templates, and values
   - Creating and managing releases
   - Local to cloud deployment

### Phase 2: Infrastructure as Code
3. **[Terraform 101](./03-TERRAFORM-101.md)**
   - Infrastructure as Code concepts
   - Terraform basics: providers, resources, state
   - Writing and applying configurations
   - Managing GCP resources

### Phase 3: Cloud Platforms
4. **[GKE 101](./04-GKE-101.md)**
   - Google Kubernetes Engine overview
   - Creating and managing clusters
   - Node pools and autoscaling
   - Networking and security

5. **[Firebase 101](./05-FIREBASE-101.md)**
   - Firebase Authentication
   - Google Identity Platform
   - Integration with applications

### Phase 4: Observability
6. **[Prometheus & Grafana 101](./06-PROMETHEUS-GRAFANA-101.md)**
   - Monitoring concepts
   - Prometheus metrics collection
   - Grafana dashboards
   - Alerting

### Phase 5: Cost Management
7. **[Cost Management 101](./07-COST-MANAGEMENT-101.md)**
   - Understanding billing reports
   - Cost optimization strategies
   - Setting up budgets and alerts
   - Resource cleanup

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Start with Kubernetes 101** - This is the foundation
2. **Set up local Kubernetes** - Get hands-on experience
3. **Work through exercises** - Build real examples
4. **Move to cloud** - Apply what you learned

## 📖 How to Use These Guides

Each guide includes:
- **Theory**: What and why
- **Local Setup**: Get it running on your machine
- **Hands-on Exercises**: Practice with real examples
- **Cloud Migration**: Apply to GCP/GKE
- **Troubleshooting**: Common issues and solutions
- **Next Steps**: What to learn next

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

- Basic command line knowledge
- Docker installed (for containerization)
- A code editor (VS Code recommended)
- Google Cloud account (for cloud sections)

## 💡 Tips for Success

1. **Don't skip exercises** - Hands-on practice is crucial
2. **Break things intentionally** - Learn by fixing mistakes
3. **Read error messages** - They're your best teachers
4. **Use local first** - Experiment freely without costs
5. **Take notes** - Document your learnings
