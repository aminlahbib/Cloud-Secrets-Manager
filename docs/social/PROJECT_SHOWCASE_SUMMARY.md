## 🎤 Presentation Formats

### 5-Minute Elevator Pitch

```
"I built Cloud Secrets Manager, an enterprise platform for managing sensitive credentials. 
It uses microservices architecture with three specialized services deployed on Kubernetes.

The interesting part is the production-grade aspects: I implemented AES-256 encryption, 
TOTP-based 2FA, and complete audit logging. I set up comprehensive monitoring with 
Prometheus and Loki, wrote 17,000+ lines of documentation, and optimized cloud costs 
to $14K/year.

The project demonstrates end-to-end ownership - from database design to Kubernetes 
deployment - and scores 7.2/10 on production readiness. It's fully open-source on GitHub."
